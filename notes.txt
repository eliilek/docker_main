Made edits to default.conf and docker-compose.yaml to attempt to set up certbot and follow tutorial.
All scripts and tutorials assume I'm running on linux
Plan: do all of this from within the DO droplet
Also figure out how to get the normal DO console working for ssh again? Did I enable some kind of firewall?
Wait obviously this will fail it's trying to collect the file from over the internet but I'm testing on local. Kleinapp.com redirects to the DO which doesn't have the new nginx conf.
