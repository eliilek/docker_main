		<b>Study Title:</b> Behavioral Outcomes of the Prosocial Program: The Impact on Measures of Social Discounting and Psychological Flexibility<br><br>
		I am a student at The Chicago School. This study is being conducted as a part of my dissertation requirement for Applied Behavior Analysis.<br><br>
		I am asking you to participate in a research study about the Prosocial approach to improving group cooperation and dynamics and how it can influence how people make decisions that affect others. You will be asked to complete a four module, self-guided training program on Prosocial, as well as complete four self-report assessments upon completion of each module of the training program. Each module will take between 60-90 minutes to complete, plus another 30-45 minutes for the self-report assessments. You will be able to complete one module per day but will be expected to complete at least one module every three days. This means the program could be as short as four days or as long as twelve days. This may cause you to feel frustrated while completing the modules. Each module will also contain brief, three question quizzes as well as a larger, ten question assessment at the end, so you may also feel some anxiety while completing them. Additionally, the self-report assessments will ask you to think about some potentially difficult decisions like deciding which friends and family you are closer with and how much money you would be willing to give them versus yourself, as well as questions about how you process difficult thoughts, feelings, and emotions, how you rank your values in life, and your perceived empathy toward others. Although you may not benefit, it will help to understand how the principles of Prosocial can enhance cooperation, empathy, and mindfulness, while also offering evidence-based strategies for fostering healthier group dynamics and interpersonal relationships.<br><br>

		<b>Purpose:</b> The objective of this study is to find whether knowledge of the Prosocial approach affects rates of social discounting, a behavioral method suggested to be objective in measuring altruistic behavior. Social discounting is an analysis of how people devalue benefits when they are distributed to others at different social distances. This objective measure offers a solid foundation for evaluating the degree of altruistic inclinations in many different circumstances. Apart from assessing social discounting, this study will incorporate evaluations of psychological flexibility, valued living, and empathy. In the end, this study could help to guide sensible approaches for encouraging moral actions. It will provide evidence-based recommendations for improving social cohesiveness and tackling societal issues by demonstrating the influence of the Prosocial method on social discounting by means of cooperative and altruistic behavior.<br><br>
		<b>Procedures:</b> During this study, you will be asked to complete a self-guided training program on the Prosocial approach to creating and managing groups. Each module will take approximately 30-60 minutes to complete. Within each module, there will be short, three-question quizzes that will take 1-2 minutes to complete. Finally, upon completing each module, you will take a ten-question module assessment that will take about 5 minutes to complete. You will need to score at least 80% or higher to pass the module and gain access to the next one. You will then be asked to complete four self-report assessments on social discounting, psychological flexibility, valued living, and empathy. You will complete these self-report assessments before starting the first module, and then upon completing each module. You will then take the self-report assessments a final time two weeks after completing the training program.<br><br>
		<b>Risks to Participants:</b> The risks of study participation are frustration and anxiety associated with completing the training program and its quizzes, along with the self-report assessments, specifically the ones that will ask you to think about some potentially difficult decisions like deciding which friends and family you are closer with and how much money you would be willing to give them versus yourself, as well as questions about how you process difficult thoughts, feelings, and emotions, how you rank your values in life, and your perceived empathy toward others. To minimize these risks, the primary investigator will make themselves available for individual consulting as needed.<br><br>
		<b>Benefits to Participants:</b> You may benefit from this study by learning new ways in which to manage groups that you oversee in your day-to-day life. These could be groups at your job, extracurricular groups, etc. Additionally, we hope the information learned from this study may benefit society in our understanding of how the principles of Prosocial can enhance cooperation, empathy, and mindfulness, while also offering evidence-based strategies for fostering healthier group dynamics and interpersonal relationships.<br><br>
